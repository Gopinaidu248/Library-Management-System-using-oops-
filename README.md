Here’s a **detailed description** of the *Library Management System* project that explains its purpose, design, and how it demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

 1️⃣ Project Overview

The **Library Management System** is a simple **console-based application** that helps manage books and users of a small library.
It provides basic operations like:

* **Adding books** to the library database,
* **Registering users** (library members),
* **Issuing books** to users,
* **Returning books**, and
* **Viewing the list of books and users**.

The system runs entirely in a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, making it lightweight and easy to run on any machine with Java installed.


2️⃣ Objectives

* To **practice and understand OOP concepts** such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction.
* To learn how to build a **multi-class Java application** with a menu-driven interface.
* To demonstrate how different classes can **interact** and work together to form a functional mini-project.


 3️⃣ Tools & Environment

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **IDE / Editor:** VS Code or IntelliJ Community Edition
* **Execution:** Java Terminal/Command Prompt

These are standard tools suitable for beginner and intermediate Java developers.


4️⃣ System Design

 a. Classes and Their Responsibilities

1. **Book Class**

   * Stores details of a single book: `id`, `title`, `author`, and whether it is currently issued or available.
   * Methods include issuing and returning a book.

2. **User Class**

   * Represents a library member with `userId` and `name`.
   * Provides a simple structure to identify who can borrow books.

3. **Library Class**

   * Acts as the central system to manage both books and users.
   * Maintains `ArrayList` collections of all books and users.
   * Handles operations such as adding books, registering users, issuing and returning books.

4. **Main Class (Driver Program)**

   * Contains the CLI menu.
   * Uses a loop to accept user input and call appropriate methods in the `Library` class.

5️⃣ Features & Functionalities

* **Add Book:** Enter book ID, title, and author to add a new book record.
* **Register User:** Enter user ID and name to create a new library member.
* **Display Books/Users:** View the current list of books and registered users.
* **Issue Book:** Change the status of a book to "Issued" when it is borrowed.
* **Return Book:** Mark a book as "Available" when it is returned.

6️⃣ How It Demonstrates OOP

This project is an excellent example of applying **OOP principles**:

* **Encapsulation:**
  Each class hides its internal details (fields) and exposes only necessary methods such as `issue()`, `returnBook()`, or `addBook()`.

* **Abstraction:**
  The `Library` class provides simple methods like `issueBook()` and `returnBook()` without revealing how the data is stored or manipulated internally.

* **Modularity:**
  Splitting the code into `Book`, `User`, `Library`, and `Main` makes the project easier to maintain, understand, and extend.

* **Object Interaction:**
  The `Library` object interacts with `Book` and `User` objects to perform operations, showing how objects can communicate and work together.

7️⃣ Expected Outcome

After running the program:

* The user can **manage a small digital library** entirely through a simple text-based menu.
* It builds a **solid understanding of how to structure multi-class Java projects**.
* It lays the foundation for more advanced applications, such as:

  * Adding a database connection,
  * Implementing search functionality,
  * Creating a graphical user interface (GUI).

 8️⃣ Possible Enhancements

* Track which specific user has borrowed a book.
* Store data in a file or database so that records are not lost when the program ends.
* Add search or filter options for books and users.
* Implement error handling (e.g., preventing duplicate IDs).
