# Library-Management-System-using-oops-
This mini-project demonstrates core OOP concepts such as:  Encapsulation: Data of books and users is hidden in classes.  Abstraction: Library operations (issue/return/search) are provided as methods.  Users can add books, register users, issue books, return books, and view details from the console.
